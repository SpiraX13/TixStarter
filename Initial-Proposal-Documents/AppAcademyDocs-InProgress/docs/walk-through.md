## Home Page

The homepage is a one-page style theme.

The first page you see will look a little something like this:

The top menu bar will have three options:
-	Sign In
-	Sign Up
-	Demo Account

All three will open a modal, with looks inspired by the GitHub sign-in:

That is to say, there will be a backround photo. You’ll enter your first_name, last_name, username, and password.

Success will redirect you to the homepage, but with different menu options:
-	My Profile
-	My Tickets
-	My Events
-	Create An Event

At the bottom of the home splash, where the “Check Our Profile” button is in the example below, there will be two buttons.

-	Search Events
-	Learn More

The “Search Events” button will take you to the second page-section down in the one-page homepage: our EventIndex (with instant search).

That page has a search bar at the top, and eight EventIndexItems below, chosen based on the search parameters.
