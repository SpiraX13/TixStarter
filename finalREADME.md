# TixStarter

TixStarter is an event ticketing web application. Inspired by KickStarter, Events must achieve a revenue goal in order to be funded. Unlike KickStarter, the mechanism for funding on TixStarter is with ticket sales -- not donations.

Users can sign in, buy tickets, and create Events. Events have multiple showtimes, each of which has multiple tickets. After enter only a few pieces of information, users are able to create a full splash onepage website for their Events, featuring beautiful imagery and embedded videos. The process of buying tickets, meanwhile, is engaging and interactive.

TixStarter is a full-stack application. We utilize Ruby on Rails on the back-end with a PostgreSQL database. On the front-end, we use React.js with a Flux architectural framework. And, of course, there's plenty of html and javascript mixed in.

### Single-Page App

FresherNote is truly a single-page; all content is delivered on one static page.  The root page listens to a `SessionStore` and renders content based on a call to `SessionStore.currentUser()`.  Sensitive information is kept out of the frontend of the app by making an API call to `SessionsController#get_user`.

```ruby
class Api::SessionsController < ApplicationController
    def get_user
      if current_user
        render :current_user
      else
        render json: errors.full_messages
      end
    end
 end
  ```

### Note Rendering and Editing

  On the database side, the notes are stored in one table in the database, which contains columns for `id`, `user_id`, `content`, and `updated_at`.  Upon login, an API call is made to the database which joins the user table and the note table on `user_id` and filters by the current user's `id`.  These notes are held in the `NoteStore` until the user's session is destroyed.  

  Notes are rendered in two different components: the `CondensedNote` components, which show the title and first few words of the note content, and the `ExpandedNote` components, which are editable and show all note text.  The `NoteIndex` renders all of the `CondensedNote`s as subcomponents, as well as one `ExpandedNote` component, which renders based on `NoteStore.selectedNote()`. The UI of the `NoteIndex` is taken directly from Evernote for a professional, clean look:

Note editing is implemented using the Quill.js library, allowing for a Word-processor-like user experience.

### Notebooks

Implementing Notebooks started with a notebook table in the database.  The `Notebook` table contains two columns: `title` and `id`.  Additionally, a `notebook_id` column was added to the `Note` table.  

The React component structure for notebooks mirrored that of notes: the `NotebookIndex` component renders a list of `CondensedNotebook`s as subcomponents, along with one `ExpandedNotebook`, kept track of by `NotebookStore.selectedNotebook()`.  

`NotebookIndex` render method:

```javascript
render: function () {
  return ({this.state.notebooks.map(function (notebook) {
    return <CondensedNotebook notebook={notebook} />
  }
  <ExpandedNotebook notebook={this.state.selectedNotebook} />)
}
```
## Future Directions for the Project

In addition to the features already implemented, I plan to continue work on this project.  The next steps for FresherNote are outlined below.

### Search

Searching notes is a standard feature of Evernote.  I plan to utilize the Fuse.js library to create a fuzzy search of notes and notebooks.  This search will look go through tags, note titles, notebook titles, and note content.  

### Direct Messaging

Although this is less essential functionality, I also plan to implement messaging between FresherNote users.  To do this, I will use WebRTC so that notifications of messages happens seamlessly.
